# HotelYeah!
// Brief description of what this product aims to accomplish
HotelYeah! is a hotel booking service that allows users to log-in, access their favorite hotels, book a new hotel, post new hotels, remove hotels that are no longer available, filter by category, location, and availability. 

This is a full-stack application built by Runtime Terror. The backend is built using Spring Boot (the repository can be found here: ), the frontend is built using React/Redux, and it will be hosted on an AWS cloud server using a PostgreSQL DB and a Jenkins CLI.
